3. Toggle between light and dark themes using the switch

## Technologies

1. React & TypeScript

2. Styled-components

3. Axios for API requests

4. OMDb API

5. Jest & React Testing Library for unit tests

## Testing

1. Unit test suites have been created for two components under a seperate folder
   i. Search Bar component
   ii. Movie details overlay component.
2. Run tests with:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Design

1.  Architecture:
    - React functional components with hooks for state management.

    - Context API for theme management and persisting state in Local storage.

    - Styled-components for modular and theme-aware styling.

    - Axios for API requests.

    - Jest for running unit tests and mocking modules.

    - Responsive layouts using media queries

    - Added a simple validation function for the search term.

    - Caching Strategy:
      - LocalStorage-backed cache:
        - movieCache stores search results.

        - detailsCache stores detailed movie data.

        - Workflow:
          - Check the cache before making an API call.

          - If cached, return data immediately.

          - If not, fetch from OMDb, store in cache, and persist to localStorage.

    - Map structure: Fast lookups using JavaScript Map.

    - Persistence: Updates to the cache are saved to localStorage to survive reloads.

2.  Limitations:
    - Cache can grow indefinitely, no TTL (time-to-live) strategy, and data may become stale until the user manually refreshes.
    - API key quota limits (1000/day), occasional inconsistent data ("N/A" values), and lack of advanced filtering.
    - No lazy loading for images (posters), no pagination/infinite scroll for large result sets.
    - No Pagination: The APIâ€™s search results only return up to 10 results per page.
